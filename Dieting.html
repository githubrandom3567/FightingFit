        First thing to know is macronutrients this is carbohydrates, protein and fat. carbohydrates are the body main source of energy best source of carbohydrates are potatoes, pasta, rice and oats. next is protein this is used primarily to build muscle, but it has many other functions like immune protection and serve as an enzyme catalyst. last is fat this is used for absorption of fat dissolvable vitamins and hormone regulation.

        then there are micronutrients these are things such as vitamins and minerals you get from foods these help the body function optimally an example of this would be calcium you get from milk or vitamin C from citrus fruits. the get the benefits of vitamins and minerals you need to have sufficient macronutrients.

        Then there are calories but not all calories are created equally e.g., carbohydrates are 4 calories per gram, protein is 4 calories per gram, fat is 9 calories per gram and alcohol is 7 calories per gram but provides not nutritional value. if you are losing weight THE ONLY WAY IS A CALORIES DEFICIT and if you are gaining muscle THE ONLY WAY IS A COLORIE SURPLUS AND INCREASED PROTINE INTAKE. 90% of clients normally want a weight loss programme The way of making a calorie deficit is to expend more energy than you can consume so you need to count how many calories you are consuming also your calorie intake will be different based on the following:
