    <h3>How i got into fitness</h3>
    <p>
        I never liked sports as a child every PE session in school I never had my kit, or I just bunked off like many other lessons I didn’t enjoy. The only time I enjoyed PE in school was when it was in the gym room. I later discovered that they had an after-school gym club now my attendance in school was dismal when I was supposed to be there so me considering an after-school activity/club was complete heresy to anyone who heard it. But every week I would show up and that’s how it started in 2014. they eventually stopped this club either because teachers couldn’t be bothered to host it or lack of funding so it was when I started college would I got back into training originally on a business course (I didn’t enjoy business that much) but I completed the full year all the while training at the gym. I then read a book stating you should follow passion first and money second also I read some psychology books and found Maslow’s hierarchy of needs and realised that sport would be a far better career for me.

    <p>The story of how I got into Martial arts is an equally confusing one, but this started though playing with knives at around 12 years old then the BO staff and finally <a href="MuayThai.html">Muay thai.</a> I originally started with kickboxing I found that it was a good base martial art but lacked live drills and I didn’t enjoy the belt grading system it is outdated and not an accurate representation of skill whereas Muay Thai don’t use belts you learn though experience and conditioning not by repeating moves in a sequence. But at 16 I discovered Muay Thai and really enjoyed the sport and the people that practiced it plus after a few weeks of training my skill vastly improved due to the better teaching method I learnt more in those few Weeks than I had in years of kickboxing.</p>
