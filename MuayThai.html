        Kickboxing and Muay Thai What are the key Differences?
        <br>
        <br>
        Muay Thai, or Thai kickboxing, is a fast, brutal combat sport. Muay Thai is known as the Art of Eight Limbs because the fighters may use eight contact points kicks, knees, elbows, and punches.
        <br>
        <br>
        You will use the clinch (grab/hold) to control your fight, limiting the damage that you take. Muay Thai teaches lots of defensive tactics, but the real deal is the offense. Muay Thai fighters need to set up powerful, fight-finishing blows to quickly get rid of an opponent.
        <br>
        <br>
        What is Kickboxing?
        <br>
        <br>
        Kickboxing offers many of the same techniques and fundamentals as pure boxing does. In fact, a good kickboxer would feel comfortable in the boxing ring fighting under regular boxing rules this has a lot to do with footwork. You can’t really say that about Muay Thai fighting.
        <br>
        <br>
        Kickboxers usually circle in, advancing towards their opponent with great ease. The kickboxer will need good head movements to avoid being struck and to avoid being knocked out.
        <br>
        <br>
        How is Muay Thai Different from Kickboxing?
        <br>
        <br>
        Both these arts are very strategic they both teach setups, footwork, and other techniques so as to avoid powerful blows from the opponent The differences between the two are:
        <br>
        <br>
        Muay Thai has an 8-point striking system and kickboxing has a 4-point striking system.
        <br>
        <br>
        Muay Thai fighters move primarily forward. They take their time until they see an opening from the opponent then they aggressively advance forward and strike. This gap comes when the opponent has probably thrown a strike of their own and the Muay Thai fighter needs to counter-attack, which is a fundamental part of Muay Thai.
        <br>
        <br>
        There is less movement, circling, and weaving with Muay Thai like you will see with kickboxing. Kickboxers are generally more fluid and defensive with their movements. They use their footwork and angles a little more than Muay Thai fighters do.
        <br>
        <br>
        The types of strikes are also different. If the Muay Thai fighter misses a strike, he doesnt easily lose his or her balance. With kickboxing, there is a wider range of strikes which are quite difficult to pull off and could throw the kickboxer off-balance if they miss.
        <br>
        <br>
        Kicking also differs. It is a rare sight to see a Muay Thai fighter kicking with the foot or lower shin they land their blows using the middle section of their shin. With kickboxing, there are a wide range of kicks that use the foot, lower shin, and middle shin alike. A round house kick to the upper leg is the bread and butter of Muay Thai the aim is to make it too painful to walk on.
        <br>

        Which is More Effective for Self Defence? Muay Thai Vs Kickboxing
        <br>
        <br>
    Muay Thai is better for combat, offering the fighter additional ways to attack which kickboxing doesn’t. Muay Thai also teaches clinch fighting as well as the use of knees, elbows and back fists. Kickboxing might be slightly better when it comes to punching training, but Muay Thai makes up for that with their elbows and knees. Also, I have found that conditioning is better for Muay Thai as you learn to handle pain of blocking with your shin and limit the force of other kicks by blocking not just dodging it still hurts.
        <br>
        <br>
        kickboxing kicks are also considered to be not as effective as the Muay Thai kicks. I say that Muay Thai kicks are definably more powerful in terms of damage and force generation but kickboxing kicks can still be effective dependent on how they are used.
