    <h3>How i got into fitness</h3>
    <p>I never liked sports as a child every PE session in school I never had my kit or I just bunked off like many other lessons I didnt enjoy. The only time I enjoyed PE in schoool was when it was in the gym room. I later discovered that they had an after school gym club now my attendence in school was dismal when I was supposed to be there so me considering an after school activity/club was complete heresy to anyone who heard it. But every week I would show up and thats how it started in 2014. they eventually stopped this club either because teachers couldnt be bothered to host it or lack of funding so it was when I started college would i got back into training originally on a business course (I didnt enjoy business that much) but I completed the full year all the while training at the gym. I then read a book stating you should follow passion first and money second also i read some psychology books and found Maslows heirarcy of needs and realised that sport would be a far better career for me.</p>
    <p>The story of how i got into Martial arts is an equally confusing one but this actually started though playing with knives at around 12 years old then the BO staff and finally <a href="MuayThai.html">Muay thai.</a> </p>
